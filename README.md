# Ved-Vimarsh

**Ved-Vimarsh** is a philosophical dialogue simulator that brings four iconic Indian philosophers to life — **Shankaracharya**, **Madhvacharya**, **Ramanujacharya**, and **Charvaka** — as they engage in an ongoing debate about truth, reality, divinity, and the nature of existence.

Built on top of the **Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat** model; , TetraTalk rotates randomly through the four thinkers, prompting them to question, answer, and challenge one another in an emergent conversation.
